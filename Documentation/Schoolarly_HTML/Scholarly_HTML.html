        ODA (Open Dataset Visualizer) is a semantic web applicaton which has the purpose to represent data 
        from open datasets in different forms. The main target of the application is to provide userful visualizations 
        to end users in order to understand better data / information / knowledge. The system is designed to allow users 
        to write a raw SPARQL queries, to specify which column of their representation they want to be included in the resulted 
        chart and in what type of chart they want to be data represented.

        Open Dataset Visualizer is a web application which will provide useful visualizations for better understanding of 
        data retrieved via a SPARQL endpoint. In order to use ODA, users should create an account and based on their authorization they
        will be allowed to perform different actions:
        <ul>
          <li>
            write raw SPARQL queries in the application's query editor, choose which columns of retrieved data will be represented 
            and what kind diagrams will represent the result;
          </li>
          <li>
            save certain charts to be used later with other purposes;
          </li>
          <li>
            update saved diagrams by adding, deleting, modifing columns / data source;
          </li>
          <li>
            delete a saved representation associated with their account;
          </li>
          <li>
            share a chart with another user; 
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The application is built in 3 modules (which will be described in the following document sections):
        <ul>
          <li>
            Authentication and authorization web API;
          </li>
          <li>
            SPQRQL data retrieving web API;
          </li>
          <li>
            User interface and user experience: writing queries, visualize charts (represented data), save and 
            share charts
          </li>
        </ul>

        The application will be used by users to represent different kind of data in several types of charts. 
        The information is retireved via a SPARQL endpoint implemented in <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> from different open datasets.

        <p>
          SPARQL is a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/">query language</a> and a 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-protocol/">protocol</a> 
          for accessing RDF designed by <a href="https://www.w3.org/2009/sparql/wiki/Main_Page">W3C</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As a query language, SPARQL is “data-oriented” in that it only queries the information held in the models; 
          there is no inference in the query language itself.  Of course, the Jena model may be ‘smart’ in that it 
          provides the impression that certain triples exist by creating them on-demand, including OWL reasoning. 
          SPARQL does not do anything other than take the description of what the application wants, in the form of a query, 
          and returns that information, in the form of a set of bindings or an RDF graph. (Apache Jena)

        <p>
          <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@comunica/query-sparql">Comunica SPARQL</a> is a SPARQL query engine for 
          JavaScript for querying over decentralized RDF knowledge graphs on the Web.
          It's main distinguishing features are the following:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Execute SPARQL 1.1 or GraphQL-LD queries;
            </li>
            <li>
              Federated querying over heterogeneous interfaces, such as RDF files, SPARQL endpoints, Triple Pattern Fragments, or Solid data pods;
            </li>
            <li>
              High modularity enabling easy extensions and customization.

          In ODA, when an user wants to retireve data by writing an SPARQL query in the page query editor, they will be able 
          to specify which open dataset they target. Being a flexible application, user has the posibility to insert the link of
          the most used open datasets:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="https://www.dbpedia.org/">Dbpedia</a>
            </li>

      <section id="sparql-endpoint">
        <h3><span>3.4 </span>SPARLQ endpoint</h3>
        <p>
          In order to retireve data from chosen open dataset, the user has to write a SPQRQL query in the 
          query editor. When submitting the written query, an API call will be made by the front-end application.
          That API will execute the query on the specified open dataset and return the results in order to be 
          represented in different ways in the page application.
        </p>
        <p>
          The SPARQL endpoint is implemented in <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>, an open source server environment 
          which uses JavaScript in the server. The endpoint will use <a href="https://expressjs.com/">ExpressJS</a>, a minimal 
          and flexible <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> web application framework.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instantiating a QueryEngine object 
          <pre><code>const queryEngine = new QueryEngine();</code></pre>,
          the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> endpoint will query the specified open dataset to be returned 
          to the front-end application and to be represented in order to be better understanted.
        </p>
        <p>
          A piece of code exemplifying how <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@comunica/query-sparql">Comunica query-sparkql</a>
          executes an SPARQL query:

          <pre><code>
            const bindingsStream = await queryEngine.queryBindings(
              `PREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>
              PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>
              PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> 
              SELECT ?country ?city ?city_name ?country_name
              WHERE {
                  ?city rdf:type dbo:City ;
                        foaf:name ?city_name ;
                        dbo:country ?country ;
                        dbo:populationTotal ?population ;
                        ?country rdf:type dbo:Country ;
                            foaf:name ?country_name .
              
                  ?country foaf:name \"Romania\"@en .
              
                  FILTER(langMatches(lang(?city_name), \"en\"))
              }
              ORDER BY ?city_name
              LIMIT 100`,
              {
                sources: ['https://dbpedia.org/sparql'],
              },
            );
          </code></pre>
          Futher, the <code>bindingsStream</code> object method: <code>bindingsStream.get('columnName')</code> gets value for specified 
          data column, in the end the endpoint returning all the  user's selected columns to the front-end application represents it 
          in charts.

      <h2><span>4. </span>Authentication and authorization</h2>
      <p>
        ODA application allows users to qury an open dataset via a SPARQL endpoint implemented in Node.js as described above. In order to perform 
        all specified actions, firstly they have to register in the application with an username and a password. Based on their credentials, 
        the users will be allowed to save and update an SPARQL query or to share a query with another application user.
        As it can be seen in the project architecture presented above, there will be implementend three microservice for every section of the 
        application: authentication, open datasets queries and authorization in order to perform different actions to an executed query.
      </p>
      <section id="auth-authentication">
        <h3><span>4.1 </span>Authentication endpoints</h3>
          In order to save, update and delete or to share a SPARQL query, the users should have an account. For this part of the application 
          we will have an authentication microservice implemented in Java Spring Framework.
          For authentication there will be the following Java endpoints:
          <ul>
            <li>
              POST: <b>auth/user</b> - create an user account
            </li>
            <li>
              GET: <b>auth/user/{id}</b> - get user account by id
            </li>
            <li>
              PUT: <b>auth/user/{id}</b> - update an user credentials 
            </li>
            <li>
              DELETE: <b>auth/user/{id}</b> - delete an user account
            </li>
          </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="auth-authentication">
        <h3><span>4.2 </span>Authorization endpoints</h3>
        Having an account, users are allowed to share their SPARQL queries and their visualization with other users on the platform.
        To do so, they must have the permission to share a specific query. This part of the application will be represented by another 
        microservice implemented in Java Spring Framework.
        For authorization there will be the following Java endpoints:
        <ul>
          <li>
            POST: <b>auth/access</b> - create a permission for a specific query
          </li>
          <li>
            GET: <b>auth/access/{userId}</b> - get all user's query list by user id
          </li>
          <li>
            PUT: <b>auth/user/{userId}</b> - update permissions for a query 
          </li>
          <li>
            DELETE: <b>auth/user/{userId}/{queryId}</b> - delete an user's query 
          </li>
        </ul>
