        ODA (Open Dataset Visualizer) is a semantic web applicaton which has the purpose to represent data 
        from open datasets in different forms. The main target of the application is to provide userful visualizations 
        to end users in order to understand better data / information / knowledge. The system is designed to allow users 
        to write a raw SPARQL queries, to specify which column of their representation they want to be included in the resulted 
        chart and in what type of chart they want to be data represented.

      <p>
        Open Dataset Visualizer is a web application which will provide useful visualizations for better understanding of 
        data retrieved via a SPARQL endpoint. In order to use ODA, users should create an account and based on their authorization they
        will be allowed to perform different actions:
        <ul>
          <li>
            write raw SPARQL queries in the application's query editor, choose which columns of retrieved data will be represented 
            and what kind diagrams will represent the result;
          </li>
          <li>
            save certain charts to be used later with other purposes;
          </li>
          <li>
            update saved diagrams by adding, deleting, modifing columns / data source;
          </li>
          <li>
            delete a saved representation associated with their account;
          </li>
          <li>
            share a chart with another user; 
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The application is built in 3 modules (which will be described in the following document sections):
        <ul>
          <li>
            Authentication and authorization web API;
          </li>
          <li>
            SPQRQL data retrieving web API;
          </li>
          <li>
            User interface and user experience: writing queries, visualize charts (represented data), save and 
            share charts
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2><span>3. </span>Arhitecture</h2>
      <p>
        Our application architecture will be described via the following diagrams:
      </p>
      <div style="display: flex; justify-content:center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column; ">

        <figcaption style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 12px;">Fig.1 - ODa Backend architecture</figcaption>
      </div>
      <p>For the backend we've decided to take a modular - microservice approach. This can help us develop the modules independently and integrate those together when they are done. Such approach
        also helps us with the testing and allows each person responsible for the microservice to develop in the desired language without imposing it on the other developers. All the microservices
      will be glued together with the help of an API Gateway. Diving deeper into each of the microservices :</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Authentication and authorization</b> - this microservice will be responsible for the authentication and authorization of the users. 
           It will be implemented in Java using Spring Boot. The authorization will be done using the roles of the users.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>SPARQL Query Microservice</b> - this microservice will be responsible for the retrieval of the data from the SPARQL endpoint. 
          It will be implemented in NodeJS. The data will be retrieved using the SPARQL queries written by the users.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Sharing Visualization Microservice</b> - this microservice will be responsible for the sharing of the visualizations between users.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div style="display: flex; justify-content:center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column; ">

        <figcaption style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 12px;">Fig.2 - ODa Frontend architecture</figcaption>
      </div>
      <p>For the frontend we've decided to use React as the frontend backbone because of the flexibility this library offers. With the help of React we can create SPA's that 
        can easily act both as an application and a browser extension. Diving deeper into the React app, we can see the following modules
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Client state management - Zustand</b> : Zustand is a state management library that is built on top of React.
           It is very lightweight and easy to use. It is also very flexible and allows us to create our own state management system.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Routing - react-router</b> : react-router is a routing library for React. It allows us to create routes and navigate between them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>SparQL Queries - Comunica</b> : Comunica is a SPARQL query engine that can be used to query SPARQL endpoints.
           It is very flexible and can be used in different environments.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Charts - Recharts</b> : Recharts is a charting library for React. It is very flexible and allows us to create different types of charts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Visualizations: Recharts, React Chart js 2, Victory, Visx, Nivo</b> : We will use different charting libraries to create different types of charts or any other types of visualizations.

      <p>
        We've designed a set of diagrams that will explain all the flow that the users can have within the application as well as how the modules of our application interact 
        with each other and what's the sequence of the actions that the user can perform.

        </div>
        <p>
          The activity diagram describes the flow of the user actions within the application in order of their execution. When the user will first enter the application he 
          can directly input the SPARQL query in the query editor and execute it. After the query has been executed and the user received the data he can choose which columns he wants to
          visualize and what type of visualization he wants to use. After the user has chosen the columns and the type of visualization he will see the visualization.
          The user then can save the visualization if he wants to for later use, but in order to do that he will have to create an account. If the user already has an account he can login.
          After the user has logged in he can save the visualization and use it later. The user can also share the visualization with other users. The user can view other user's visualizations
          and use them for his own purposes if he has the permission to do so and the link to the visualization

        <p>
          The use case diagram describes the users we will have in our application and the actions that they can perform. 
          We will have 2 types of users: the users that are not logged in and the users that are logged in which are called unauthorised and authorised user.
          Unauthorised users can perform the following actions
          <ul>
            <li>
              Execute SPARQL queries
            </li>
            <li>
              Visualize the data with the desired visualization and with the desired columns

          Authorised users can perform all the actions unauthorised can and also the following actions
          <ul>
            <li>
              Save the visualizations
            </li>

        </div>
        <p>
          The sequence diagram describes how modules interact with each other based on the user actions. ODa module represents the front-end application and is the only thing that the user interacts with.
          The ODa module will send the SPARQL query to the SPARQL Query Microservice. The SPARQL Query Microservice will send the query to the SPARQL endpoint and will receive the data.
          The SPARQL Query Microservice will send the data to the ODa module and the ODa module will display the data to the user. The user can then choose which columns he wants to visualize and what type of visualization he wants to use.
          The ODa module within it will create the visualization and will show it to the user.
          If the user wants to save the visualization he will have to create an account or login if he already has an account.
          The ODa module will send the request to the Auth Microservice with the credentials the user entered.
          The Auth Microservice will check if the user credentials are valid and will send back the response if the user is allowed to save the visualization.
          If the user is allowed to save the visualization the ODa module will send the request to the Sharing Microservice with the data of the visualization.
          The Sharing Microservice will save the visualization in the Database and will send back the response to the ODa module.
          If the user wants to share the visualization with other users he will select which visualization he wants to share.
          The ODa module will send the request to the Sharing Microservice with the data of the visualization.
          The Sharing Microservice will change the permissions to the visualization and will send back the response to the ODa module.
          If the user wants to view other user's visualizations he will enter the link of the visualization.
          The ODa module will send the request to the Sharing Microservice with the link of the visualization.
          The Sharing Microservice will check if the user has the permission to view the visualization and will send back the response to the ODa module.

        The application will be used by users to represent different kind of data in several types of charts. 
        The information is retireved via a SPARQL endpoint implemented in <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> from different open datasets.

        <h3><span>5.1 </span>SPAQRL</h3>

          SPARQL is a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/">query language</a> and a 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-protocol/">protocol</a> 
          for accessing RDF designed by <a href="https://www.w3.org/2009/sparql/wiki/Main_Page">W3C</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As a query language, SPARQL is “data-oriented” in that it only queries the information held in the models; 
          there is no inference in the query language itself.  Of course, the Jena model may be ‘smart’ in that it 
          provides the impression that certain triples exist by creating them on-demand, including OWL reasoning. 
          SPARQL does not do anything other than take the description of what the application wants, in the form of a query, 
          and returns that information, in the form of a set of bindings or an RDF graph. (Apache Jena)

          JavaScript for querying over decentralized RDF knowledge graphs on the Web.
          It's main distinguishing features are the following:

          In ODA, when an user wants to retireve data by writing an SPARQL query in the page query editor, they will be able 
          to specify which open dataset they target. Being a flexible application, user has the posibility to insert the link of
          the most used open datasets:

        <h3><span>5.4 </span>SPARLQ endpoint</h3>
        <p>
          In order to retireve data from chosen open dataset, the user has to write a SPQRQL query in the 
          query editor. When submitting the written query, an API call will be made by the front-end application.
          That API will execute the query on the specified open dataset and return the results in order to be 
          represented in different ways in the page application.
        </p>
        <p>
          The SPARQL endpoint is implemented in <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>, an open source server environment 
          which uses JavaScript in the server. The endpoint will use <a href="https://expressjs.com/">ExpressJS</a>, a minimal 
          and flexible <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> web application framework.
        </p>
        <p>
          We've decided to use the d3-sparql library in order to execute the SPARQL queries. The d3-sparql library is a
          <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/d3-sparql">Node.js</a> library that allows to execute SPARQL queries and
          to retrieve the results in JSON format. The library is based on the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/sparql-client">sparql-client</a> library.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will have the following endpoints:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>POST /sparql/</code> - It takes JSON payload in the request body that contains two properties: endpoint and query.
              It uses the d3.sparql function to make a SPARQL query to the specified endpoint with the given query.
               The results are then processed using OpenAI's Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) <code>openai.createCompletion</code> function,
                to suggest a graph type and generate natural language descriptions of the data. Finally, the results and the graph suggestion are sent back as a JSON response.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>POST /sparql/simple</code> - It is similar / route, but it does not make use of the OpenAI function.
               It only retrieves the results of the SPARQL query and returns them as a JSON response.
            </li>

        ODA application allows users to qury an open dataset via a SPARQL endpoint implemented in Node.js as described above. In order to perform 
        all specified actions, firstly they have to register in the application with an username and a password. Based on their credentials, 
        the users will be allowed to save and update an SPARQL query or to share a query with another application user.
        As it can be seen in the project architecture presented above, there will be implementend three microservice for every section of the 
        application: authentication, open datasets queries and authorization in order to perform different actions to an executed query.

        <h3><span>6.1 </span>Authentication endpoints</h3>
          In order to save, update and delete or to share a SPARQL query, the users should have an account. For this part of the application 
          we will have an authentication microservice implemented in Java Spring Framework.
          For authentication there will be the following Java endpoints:
          <ul>
            <li>
              POST: <b>auth/user</b> - create an user account
            </li>
            <li>
              GET: <b>auth/user/{id}</b> - get user account by id
            </li>
            <li>
              PUT: <b>auth/user/{id}</b> - update an user credentials 
            </li>
            <li>
              DELETE: <b>auth/user/{id}</b> - delete an user account
            </li>
          </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="auth-authentication">
        <h3><span>6.2 </span>Authorization endpoints</h3>
        Having an account, users are allowed to share their SPARQL queries and their visualization with other users on the platform.
        To do so, they must have the permission to share a specific query. This part of the application will be represented by another 
        microservice implemented in Java Spring Framework.
        For authorization there will be the following Java endpoints:
        <ul>
          <li>
            POST: <b>auth/access</b> - create a permission for a specific query
          </li>
          <li>
            GET: <b>auth/access/{userId}</b> - get all user's query list by user id
          </li>
          <li>
            PUT: <b>auth/user/{userId}</b> - update permissions for a query 
          </li>
          <li>
            DELETE: <b>auth/user/{userId}/{queryId}</b> - delete an user's query 
          </li>
        </ul>
